```

*Course objective*: Introducing high-dimensional regression and classification methods for biological data analysis.   

*Organization*: The course is divided into five sessions. Each session is made of a lecture and practical classes. In those in-class practical classes, students are given the opportunity to tackle problem-solving exercises using R.  

The following documents are provided for each session:

* a video lecture: R tutorial whose slides, data and R script are provided;   
* an Rmd file containing in-class exercises.

## Session 1

*Objective*: Setting a statistical framework for linear prediction of a real-valued or a k-class response variable. 

* [Video lecture](https://youtu.be/5KLMYWWWcsE) with [slides](./teaching/PDFs/SLBDsession1.pdf), [R script](./teaching/scripts/SLBDsession1.R) and data ([1](./teaching/data/SLBDinvasive.txt), [2](./teaching/data/SLBDcoffee.txt) and [sleep](./teaching/data/sleep.csv));   
* In-class activities:  [exercise](./teaching/pdfs/SLBDexercicesession1.pdf) and [data](./teaching/data/SLBDscanner.txt).
